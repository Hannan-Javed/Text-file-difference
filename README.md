# Text File Difference
This program outputs the difference in any two text files in the current working directory with color coding. It uses the <span style="color:#ADD8E6;">difflib</span> library.
The output is displayed both in the terminal of the program and in a new window.
## Run
Running the program is quite simple, just simply run the main.py file.
If there are more than 2 text files present in the current working directory, you will need to input (by index in the printed list of text files) which two files you need to see the text difference of. \
Two sample text files have been added in this repo as an example for illustration.
