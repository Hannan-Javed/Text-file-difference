# Text File Difference
This program outputs the difference in any two text files in the current working directory with color coding.
## Run
Running the program is quite simple. Simply run the main.py file.
If there are more than 2 text files present in the current working directory, you will need to input (by index in the printed list of text files) which two files you need to see the difference in texts of.
Two sample text files have been added in this repo as an example for illustration.
